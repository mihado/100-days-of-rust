# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 28th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: wrote hello_world, and guessing_game. learned about cargo

**Thoughts:** Rust is fun! I **love** pattern matching! At first glance, reference is easier to understand than C pointer. Cargo would definitely helps with dependencies hell. I'm used to the awesomeness of ruby bundler so I cannot use any language without something similar.

**Link to work:** [Hello World!](./00_hello_world), [Guessing Game](./01_guessing_game)
